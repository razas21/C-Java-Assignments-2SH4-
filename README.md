# C-Java-Assignments-2SH4-

The files in these folders are programs that I have written for my 'Fundamental Concepts of Programming' class (COMPENG 2SH4). Some files may be missing (ex. header files), but most the relevant code is there.

Labs 2 & 3 are lab assignments written in C, while Labs 4 & 5 are written in Java.
